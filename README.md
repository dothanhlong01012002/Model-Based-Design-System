This is Model-based Design System Course provied by Mathworks. In this course, you can learn how to modeling plant and controller of a simple system. After that, you will to learn what is MIL, SIL, PIL HIL Tetsing and practive some test( MIL, SIL). Moveover, you can similar with real-time tesing: create xPC from real-time toolbox in matlab and run controller/plant in real-time environment. You can learn how to use Simulink Test or test harness to create test cases to verify and validate this system.
